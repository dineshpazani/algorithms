Left join and Left outer join are same. The only thing is that an extra keyword outer!

Basically Outer join is of three types : 1. Left join 2. Right join 3. Full outer join .

As these are types of outer join we even call them as left outer join and right outer join.

    LEFT JOIN returns all the rows from left table and matched ones from right table.
    RIGHT JOIN returns all the rows from the right table and matched ones from left table.
    FULL OUTER JOIN returns unmatched rows from both tables.
